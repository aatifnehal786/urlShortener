              THE LANGUAGES AND APPROACH USED TO DEVELOPE THIS PROJECT IS NODEJS EXPRESS AND FOR DATABASE CREATION AND STORATION MONGODB IS USED WITH A THIRD PARTY LIBRARY MONGOOSE. 
              <BR>
              APPROACH : WE USE A MODULE CALLED NANOID TO CREATE A UNIQUE ID FOR EACH SHORTEN URL
                         THE SHORT URL IS GENERATED WITH UNIQUE URL CODE AND WE CREATE A OBJECT WITH VALUES HAVING LARGE URL , SHORT URL , URL CODE, ACCESSED TIME , CREATION TIME , AND THE ANALYTICS DATA LIKE THE USER-AGENT -- THE URL REQUEST IS CALLED BY WITH AGENT , IP OF THE USER , NUMBER OF TIMES THE SHORTEN URL HAS BEEN ACCESSED.
                         <BR>

            INSTRUCTIONS TO USE : FIRST ENTER A LARGE URL THEN THE API WILL CREATE A SHORT URL OR CUSTOM SHORT URL IF PASSED BY THE USER. THEN THE USER CAN DIRECTLY ACCESS THE LARGE URL BY URL CODE AND USER CAN ALSO SEE THE ANALYTICS DATA BY THE ANALYTICS / URL CODE PATH NAME
